# Welcome to DansTechWorld!

## About Me
I’m a U.S. Army veteran with a passion for technology and cybersecurity.  
I’m currently pursuing my B.S. in Cybersecurity & Information Assurance at WGU while building skills in security engineering and automation.  
My long-term goal is to grow into a Security Engineer and master the mighty Python along this learning trail.  
I believe in learning through collaboration, staying hands-on, and sharing knowledge so others can grow alongside me.  

## What You’ll Find Here
This page is my space for learning in public and sharing along the way.  

Expect content like:  
- Beginner-friendly IT guides to help others break into the field  
- Labs and hands-on walkthroughs (Linux, cloud, security)  
- Notes, tips, and tricks from my studies and projects  
- Write-ups from security exercises  

## Motto
*“Life is what you make it.”*  
A line my mom repeated to me growing up. Back then it felt simple, but today it drives how I approach cybersecurity and life.
